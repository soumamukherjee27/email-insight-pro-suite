⚠️ Important Notes
Always keep your email credentials safe — avoid hardcoding them in production.

If using Gmail, you might need to enable IMAP and use an App Password (not your normal password).

Make sure your email provider supports IMAP access.

📈 Future Enhancements
Modularize code (split into multiple Python files)

Add logging and error handling

Support reading attachments

Save fetched emails into CSV/JSON

Dockerize the application for deployment
